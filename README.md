Build Your Own Starter:

      Have you ever been overwhelmed by a React starter project? Too many dependencies that you don't understand?

      Put that all aside. This tutorial will walk you through the process of building your own React starter project... from scratch.

      How it works
      In each step, you'll add one feature or dependency to your starter project.

      When you're done, you'll have a starter project exactly like ahfarmer/minimal-react-starter.

      If you use that starter on future projects, you'll understand every line and be able to easily add additional dependencies.

      Step structure
      Each step has some discussion at the top, and below a list of directions to follow.

      On the right side is the file structure, with a display similar to your IDE. Files that are new for the current step show up in green. Files that have changed are orange.

      Prerequisites
      Before beginning this tutorial, you should have the following:

      Basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
      Basic knowledge of the terminal. We'll tell you what to type but you should know how to open your terminal and how to navigate directories within it.
      Node and npm should be installed on your computer.

Git:

      Tracking your work in git is a good habit. git makes it easy to back up your work on a remote server (usually Github). If you make a mistake, you can easily revert your project to a previous step.

      I won't go into the details of git here, but I will show you the git commands you'll need to save your work at the end of each step.

      Every git project should have a README, so we also create the README.md file in this step. The notes you add to your README will be invaluable for reminding you how your project works later on.

      Open up your terminal, run the following commands, and create the following files. Then click Next to move on to the next step.
